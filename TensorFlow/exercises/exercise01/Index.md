# E01001 - Image Loader

Show how to load image with tensorflow and displayed by opencv. 
Actually, this needs you to install related libs first, such as
libgtk2.0-dev and so on. These libs are used by opencv. 

If you installed opencv with anaconda or something similar without
installing those necessary libs first, weird errors will happen. 
Don't worry about the situation, just unisntall opencv, then, ins-
tall those libs, and finally re-install opencv again. Those errors
then disappeared.
